#+TITLE: Xattr
Emacs library to interact with extended attributes

* Overview
This library enables the user to interact with extended attributes (xattrs from
now on).  Xattrs are key-value metadata that can be added to files if filesystem
supports them.  This has been tested only on Linux.

** Features
Operations that are possible on xattrs: /set/, /get/, /remove/, /list/, /empty-p/

** Motivation
I needed to tag files in dired.  I was abusing *image-dired* package to tag
files, but, in the end, it was designed to work only with media files, which
gave some troubles.  Future work will require to write some *dired-tags*
package based on this library.

* Building
You need to get /emacs-module.h/ from emacs source files and set its directory
to ~EMACS_SRC~ make variable

#+begin_src sh
make EMACS_SRC=/path/to/dir/where/emacs-module.h/is/stored
#+end_src

* Usage
#+begin_src elisp
(xattr-set "my-file-name.ext" "user.my.attribute" "with value")
;; => "with value"

(xattr-set "my-file-name.ext" "user.my.attribute2" "with value2")
;; => "with value2"

(xattr-get "my-file-name.ext" "user.my.attribute")
;; => "with value"

(xattr-list "my-file-name.ext")
;; => ("user.my.attribute" "user.my.attribute2")

(xattr-remove "my-file-name.ext" "user.my.attribute")
;; => nil

(xattr-list "my-file-name.ext")
;; => ("user.my.attribute2")

(xattr-empty-p "my-file-name.ext")
;; => nil
#+end_src
